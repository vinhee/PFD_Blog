            <p class="card-text">For week 2, my group and I are to prepare an inception deck that is to
                be presented to our sponsors : AIDC. In the inception deck, some questions that needed to
                be answered were : "Why are we here?", Product Box and Trade off Sliders etc. 
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                One problem we had during the process of the creation of the inception deck was making
                the product box. In the product box, we are to show our product, product name, top 3 benefits
                and a slogan. We find making the slogan the hardest since it had to be catchy and related to
                our product, a camera that detects faces.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                In the end, we managed to complete the inception deck after discussing amongst ourselves
                on our goals from this project. We also decided to find a simple template for the slides 
                so that there won't be any difficulty reading and understanding the slides.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                In conclusion, I quite nervous and excited to meet our sponsors next lesson, I hope that
                they like and are interested in our product. Not only that, but I hope that my team will be
                able to acheive our goals set. 
            </p>
