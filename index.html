            <p class="card-text">During class, we were given a challenge statement on Data
                Collection Applications. The challenge statement involved 3 different industries:
                Service, Manufacturing and Security.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                <b>My Contributions:</b>
                <br>
                After understanding the challenge statement, my group thought and shared
                some ideas. An idea I had was to identify the employees using a camera that has
                been AI trained to recognise their faces. The AI would then record down the employees attendance
                after going through the database of all employees' details.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                One problem I discovered as we were discussing was what can we do about the attendance
                of those who are working from home? As we discussed, we've come to an agreement to create a
                website where employees working from home can take down their attedance.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                Our finalize idea was to train the AI to identify the employees based on a database provided.
                In the database, the employees' face and details will be recorded down. If possible, one additional
                feature we would like to attempt is for the AI to be able to detect whether the person is an object 
                or a human. By doing so, it prevents other employees from helping the other employees take fake attendance
                by using a photo of them.

            <p class="card-text">
                For OAL, I did the course on becoming a Design Thinking practitioner.
                From this course, the main takeaway for me was before confirming the challenge
                statement, I should ask myself 5 whys. By doing so, I would have a challenge
                statement that takes in account of the user's perspective and reduce the chances
                of the ideas generated to be rejected by the stakeholders.

            <p class="card-text">
                Some contents of the video like creating a prototype that tests
                whether the plan would fail or not would be ideal for my team to try out.
                This is because creating a cheap and fast prototype can easily save a lot
                of money, time and effort.

                be presented to our sponsors : AIDC. In the inception deck, some questions that needed to

                One problem we had during the process of the creation of the inception deck was making

                and a slogan. We find making the slogan the hardest since it had to be catchy and related to
                our product, a camera that detects faces.

                I went on to add more things into the slides and remove the unnecessary details that may make the
                slides too wordy.

                employees who aren't in office are updated in the database to prevent the AI from sending

                I contributed to the team by creating the website and taking in the ideas of how the 
                website should look like. Our team decided to make the website easy to understand by
                having one main page that has multiple buttons leading to different services for the employees.
                I designed a simple wireframe for my team members to understand how the website would probably look
                like. The wireframe shown is not the final design of the website as there could be possible updates
                in the future.

                For week 4, our product FBEye is slowly coming together. Although we were at first worried about not
                having feedback from our sponsors about our solution. We decided to stick to our initial plan and continued 
                developing our product as complete as possible. This is so that by hackathon, we can focus more on testing and 
                improving our product.

                confirming which language we will be coding our website in. At the end of the class, we have confirmed to
                use java and html to create our website. I have also started on the website by setting it up to transfer 
                data to firebase as well as setting up some of the web pages for my teammates to get started on the front end.
                Once my teammates are done with their part, I will start with the backend part, login verification.
                The image below is our updated wireframe for our website, it may look a bit confusing but the actual website looks

                Week 5 is the week of the 2 and a half day hackathon. During the hackathon, we are to
                continue developing our prototype and present it to our sponsors on the last day. Before the 
                hackathon, my teammates and I had planned out the features that are to be completed. These
                features include : Session, Upload Photo, Connecting all the projects together (Website, Camera, Database).

                During the hackathon, I continued developing the website by doing sessions, uploading photo feature, 
                validations and lastly, fixing any problems encountered. A problem I have encountered when 
                developing the website was fetching data from the database for the website. The reason was because 
                coding in javascript was something I wasn't as familiar, hence, I had to rely on Youtube videos to find out 
                how I should code to have the certain feature working. However, a problem with following Youtube tutorials 
                was that not all the codes would work and I had to customise it whilst making sure that the website is still 
                functional. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Another thing I worked on was updating our inception deck which is 
                meant to be presented on the last day of the hackathon to our sponsor. 
                Although the presentation did not go as well as we expected, our demo was able 
                to showcase that our solution was able to fulfil one of the criteria : collecting data.
